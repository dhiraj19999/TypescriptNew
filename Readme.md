TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.


TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before
 running the code, not while running the code.


JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.


at the end typescript get converted in javascript 
its just developement tool  your project still runs in js
